                    <a href="#" class="close">X</a>
                </div>
                <p>Michael is the Regional Manager at Dunder Mifflin, a fun loving and charismatic man
                    who likes to put work aside in order to have fun. While his love for entertainment
                    often results in trouble and danger, he's always set on making life convienent</p>
                <p>Michael lives for others and their views of him, treating his office staff like family
                    and doing whatever he can to earn their love and appreciation. A bit of a narcissistic man,
                    but one who lives for love nonetheless</p>

                    <a href="#" class="close">X</a>
                </div>
                <p>Dwight is Michael's assistant to the Regional Manager, a made up position because Dwight
                    has no real leadership in the office. Dwight is a loyal worker and the top salesman at the company,
                    but he can also be a bit of a suck up to Michael</p>
                <p>Dwight is a strong rule follower who wants a well working office with no distractions, making him
                    and Jim enemies. While Dwight tends to take things to the extreme, he's still a strong worker who will
                    do whatever it takes to make it to the top</p>

                </div>
                <p>Jim is the person in the office who just doesn't care. He does his job as does it well, but he spends
                    a large portion of his time just relaxing, having fun, and pulling pranks, especially on Dwight. While
                    Jim cares about his job, he also doesn't take it too seriously</p>
                <p>Jim also spends his time with Pam in a culture defining love story, as they grow together and work and 
                    mess around together, working together once again often to prank Dwight. While Jim does well at his job, he
                    always aspires to more, and being second in command in the office isn't always quite enough</p>

                    <a href="#" class="close">X</a>
                </div>
                <p>Pam is a secretary turned saleswoman who does what she can to feel satisfied in her career. From becoming
                    a saleswoman to going to art school, Pam tries to work her way up the ranks while doing what she needs
                    to do to work and make a living</p>
                <p>Pam is a caring a fun loving person, often participating in office fun and activities alongside Jim,
                    including pranking Dwight. Pam is often the voice of reason and the one who sets the limits on things
                    while still opting for a good time</p>

                </div>
                <p>Andy is a graduate from Cornell, and he'll let you know it. Andy is an alright salesmen who came from another
                    branch of Dunder Mifflin and immediately started working his way to the top. While Andy has aspirations, he
                    isn't the strongest worker</p>
                <p>Andy is usually a pretty fun and relaxed person, but he can also flip very quickly. Andy is easily fooled and 
                    can have some pretty bad reactions to things, which is why he went through anger management. Though he can be
                    a bit of a ticking time bomb, Andy is usually a fun loving and relaxed guy

                </div>
                <p>Angela is a talented accountant who does her job well, but she can be kind of uptight. She's a very big rule 
                    follower and doesn't like a messy or chaotic office, she prefers to just get the work done. While Angela may 
                    be a bit of an opposition to much of the office, it can't be denied that she has talent in her work</p>
                <p>Angela may try to appear the way that she does, but in reality she can be a very caring person. Angela is a
                    mother of many cats and a good friend and colleague to many in the office. Angela is tough and gets the work
                    done when it's needed, but she is also very passionate about those she cares about
